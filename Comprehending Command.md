# Comprehending Commands    
## cat: not the pet, but the command!
- Learnt the `cat` command which is used for reading out files and it can concatenate multiple files if multiple arguments are provided.
- Started the challenge and entered `cat flag` in the terminal prompt to read out the contents of the flag file, thus obtaining the flag

## catting absolute paths
- Understood that we can specify cat's arguements as absolute paths.
- Started the challenge and entered `cat /flag` in the terminal prompt where /flag is the absolute path and thus obtained the flag

## more catting practice
- On starting the challenge the absolute path of the flag containing file was shown.
- I used `cat /usr/lib/php/flag` to read out the contents of the flag file thus obtaining the flag

## grepping for a needle in a haystack
- I learned the `grep` command and that it can be used to search a file for lines of text containing a specific sequence of characters(string).
- Started the challenge and entered `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt` where "pwn.college" is the argument since flags start with "pwn.college" and this obtained the flag
